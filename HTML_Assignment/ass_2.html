		<p>
			I am a lecturer in the Stanford Computer Science Department Before coming to Stanford, I spent two years as a 
			programmer at Taligent (now part of IBM). At Taligent, I worked on Places for Project Teams, a groupware product 
			designed to improve communication and coordination with small project teams. I was fortunate to work with the Places for 
			Project Teams product throughout an entire software lifecycle--from initial product conception through the actual product
			launch.
			
			I have a PhD. from the University of California, Irvine, where I specialized in Software Engineering. My dissertation was on 
			process support for software engineering teams. I also have a masters degree from Irvine, with a specialization in Artificial
			Intelligence, and bachelors degree in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.
