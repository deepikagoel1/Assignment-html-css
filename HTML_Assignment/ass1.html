		<h5 align='left'>My Trip To California</h5>
		<p>
			It was a long, quick trip. We loaded our vehicle and headed to Northern California for the 4th July of weekend for a family reunion. We then made haste to Magic Mountain. By the time we returned home, we had travelled some 1,300 miles in three and one half days.

		<p>
			After a year's preparation, it was time to go backpacking with the Boy Scouts. We  flew to Colorado Springs, toured the Air Force Academy, Pike's Peak, Garden Of The Gods, and the Olympic training center. We chartered a bus to the Philmont Scout Ranch in Northern New Mexico and began our 60 mile backpack trek. Afterwards, we boarded Amtrack's and rode the rails to Kingman, and then chartered a bus home.

		<p>
			My wife and I drove our son's little red Ford Mustang some 2,900 miles to him in Indiana where he attends college. In route, we stopped at Nauvoo, Illinois, and Detroit, Michigan. We then boarded Amtrack in Chicago, and rode it to Salt Lake City, where we boarded a bus which returned us to Las Vegas.
